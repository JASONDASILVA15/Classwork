<h2>Pattern Recognition</h2>
<p> Pattern recognition is a data analysis method that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize patterns and regularities in data. </p>
<h2>Mathematic Operators</h2>
<p>Symbols or functions that perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.</p>
<h2>Loops</h2>
<p>A sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. </p>
<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
<p> Statements that allow the execution of different blocks of code based on certain criteria. </p>
<h2>Algorithmic Thinking</h2>
<p>Aderivative of computer science and coding.</p>
<h2>Relational Operators</h2>
<p>A programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities.</p>
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>A piece of memory that stores a value that can be changed.</p>
<h2>Decomposition</h2>
<p>Breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand.</p>
<h2>Refactoring</h2>
<p>The process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the function of the code yet improves its internal structure.</p>
<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p> A fundamental operation that performs logical calculations on two or more values and produces a result based on the truth values of the inputs.</p>
<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>The process of removing elements of a code or program that aren't relevant or that distract from more important elements.</p>
<h2>Branching</h2>
<p>The practice of creating copies of programs or objects in development to work in parallel versions, retaining the original and working on the branch or making different changes to each.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous and Synchronous</h2>
<p> Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it.</p>
